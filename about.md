# JFP

### Advanced Random Wave Generation

**Note: JFP is still in active development. By actively using this mod, you acknowledge that this mod could lead to crashes and instability (particularly when exiting the game) and continue at your own risk. Remember to back up your data!**

*At the moment, JFP isn't fully compatible with certain Mega Hack in-level features like Status and Keybinds. If you want a restart key, we recommend the "Custom Keybinds" mod. -M*
