Special thanks to the Geode community and to early playtesters; you made this possible!

# Features

* Customizable corridor generation, including gravity portals, speed changes, size changes, spikes, and much more
* Robust and user-accessible theming engine + 4 default themes
* Ability to save your random seed and options in short codes, to be imported at any time

*At the moment, JFP isn't fully compatible with certain Mega Hack in-level features like Status and Keybinds. If you want to use a restart key, we recommend the "Custom Keybinds" mod.*
